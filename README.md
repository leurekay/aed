# AED监控

以下3个子目录有用:
* [AED4](AED4) 早期数据采集，及相关统计算法的实现，目前用不到。
* [web](web)  提供API接口
* [display](display)  监控数据可视化访问页面

web和display共用一个数据库(服务器上位于/data/)，其他相互独立。




# 环境配置
* ubuntu 16.04   其他linux操作系统应该也可以，windows也可以(但api接口需要在后台运行，windows下我不会操作)

* Python2.7 

* 相关的库
    * django 提供web框架  	
    * numpy  
    * sklearn 如果只使用数值突变的算法，不需要安装。  




# 解决方案
通过控制盒上传的数据，可以得到16个数字。取前12个数字来判断AED电池及设备的状态。由于电池的状态和机器的状态是近似相互独立的，所以可以把电池的状态和设备的状态分开判断，一个状态之和6个数字相关(R值，R校准，G值，G校准，B值，B校准)。


## 直观
早期对十多台AED(3种型号)，少量监控装置，两两组合，得到了一些数据，发现实际值减去校准值的分布有规律可循。下图只是对单独的R通道的可视化，发现不同状态有明显的分隔线
![Instance Segmentation Sample](AED/scatter1.jpg =100*100)


## 进阶

随着监控批次的增多，不同状态间的数据分布很难找到明显的分隔线。
![](AED4/scatter.jpg)
以上的分布我们仅仅是从单个R,单个G,单个B去看的，如果同时考虑RGB三通道，可以得到三维的数据分布，在三维空间很容易用一个平面去划分。平面的选择用到了支持向量机的算法。

## 突变
随着时间的推移，发现监控数值会随着时间衰减(大概需要连续3天以上的持续观察才可以发现)。由于监控的数值正比于LED的反射强度，所以推断是由于LED灯光强的衰减造成的，并且根据相关资料显示LED的衰减呈现指数下降趋势，所以监控数值的衰减曲线极有可能是指数曲线。很不幸，之前设计的算法就不能用了。
![](image/curve.png)
仔细观察曲线可以发现，每次状态改变时，数值会有明显的突变,我们可以根据这点来设计算法。
根据几台观测设备采集到的数据发现，故障值/正常值≈1.4，这启发我们可以这么做，计算当前值与前一时刻的比值，如果大于设定的阈值，则可认为状态发生了改变。之所以用比值而不用差值，是因为随着数值的下降，差值也会同比例的下降，不易设定一个统一的阈值。

# Training on MS COCO
We're providing pre-trained weights for MS COCO to make it easier to start. You can
use those weights as a starting point to train your own variation on the network.
Training and evaluation code is in `samples/coco/coco.py`. You can import this
module in Jupyter notebook (see the provided notebooks for examples) or you
can run it directly from the command line as such:

```
# Train a new model starting from pre-trained COCO weights
python3 samples/coco/coco.py train --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=coco

# Train a new model starting from ImageNet weights
python3 samples/coco/coco.py train --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=imagenet

# Continue training a model that you had trained earlier
python3 samples/coco/coco.py train --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=/path/to/weights.h5

# Continue training the last model you trained. This will find
# the last trained weights in the model directory.
python3 samples/coco/coco.py train --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=last
```

You can also run the COCO evaluation code with:
```
# Run COCO evaluation on the last trained model
python3 samples/coco/coco.py evaluate --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=last
```

The training schedule, learning rate, and other parameters should be set in `samples/coco/coco.py`.


# Training on Your Own Dataset

Start by reading this [blog post about the balloon color splash sample](https://engineering.matterport.com/splash-of-color-instance-segmentation-with-mask-r-cnn-and-tensorflow-7c761e238b46). It covers the process starting from annotating images to training to using the results in a sample application.

In summary, to train the model on your own dataset you'll need to extend two classes:

```Config```
This class contains the default configuration. Subclass it and modify the attributes you need to change.

```Dataset```
This class provides a consistent way to work with any dataset. 
It allows you to use new datasets for training without having to change 
the code of the model. It also supports loading multiple datasets at the
same time, which is useful if the objects you want to detect are not 
all available in one dataset. 

See examples in `samples/shapes/train_shapes.ipynb`, `samples/coco/coco.py`, `samples/balloon/balloon.py`, and `samples/nucleus/nucleus.py`.

## Differences from the Official Paper
This implementation follows the Mask RCNN paper for the most part, but there are a few cases where we deviated in favor of code simplicity and generalization. These are some of the differences we're aware of. If you encounter other differences, please do let us know.

* **Image Resizing:** To support training multiple images per batch we resize all images to the same size. For example, 1024x1024px on MS COCO. We preserve the aspect ratio, so if an image is not square we pad it with zeros. In the paper the resizing is done such that the smallest side is 800px and the largest is trimmed at 1000px.
* **Bounding Boxes**: Some datasets provide bounding boxes and some provide masks only. To support training on multiple datasets we opted to ignore the bounding boxes that come with the dataset and generate them on the fly instead. We pick the smallest box that encapsulates all the pixels of the mask as the bounding box. This simplifies the implementation and also makes it easy to apply image augmentations that would otherwise be harder to apply to bounding boxes, such as image rotation.

    To validate this approach, we compared our computed bounding boxes to those provided by the COCO dataset.
We found that ~2% of bounding boxes differed by 1px or more, ~0.05% differed by 5px or more, 
and only 0.01% differed by 10px or more.

* **Learning Rate:** The paper uses a learning rate of 0.02, but we found that to be
too high, and often causes the weights to explode, especially when using a small batch
size. It might be related to differences between how Caffe and TensorFlow compute 
gradients (sum vs mean across batches and GPUs). Or, maybe the official model uses gradient
clipping to avoid this issue. We do use gradient clipping, but don't set it too aggressively.
We found that smaller learning rates converge faster anyway so we go with that.
